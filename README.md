## RC Primer: Incredibly Easy Parallelization: High throughput computing.

Do you need to run a computational model hundreds of times? Process thousands of images? If so, high performance computing systems like CU Boulder's Alpine can greatly accelerate your work by enabling you to run 100s to 1000s of iterations simultaneously (known as high-throughput computing, HTC).

This RC Primer* will introduce you to the available tools and techniques to quickly adapt your workflow for HTC!

_What is an RC Primer?: An RC Primer is a session that provide an introduction to concepts, systems, and tools. You can expect to leave "Primers" with an introductory-level understanding of the topic._
